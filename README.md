Smart Contract Time Based Deposit
The two contracts are examples of templates to be used in the OpenLaw software. I have attempted to incorporate the OpenLaw Markup language.
Once the contracts have been signed they are then sent to http://notareth.herokuapp.com/ to be hashed and uploaded to the Ethereum blockchain. 
The hash is provided to all parties.
The hash can also be used to be uploaded to the contract.
